# Social Bubble
Social Bubble is a social networking site that provides contract tracing for COVID-19, allowing users to build social groups, or bubbles. The users can then share their covid status or messages to their social bubbles, so everyone can know their friends and families are healthy, while protecting themselves at the same time.

## Inspiration
The Covid-19 Pandemic has changed our lives in a drastic way. It's though not being to be with family and friends for fear of contracting or the virus. We wanted to find a way for a group of people to know if it's safe to meet up during this pandemic.


## Features
  - Create Social Bubbles
  - Add users by their login email to the bubble
  - Send messages to bubbles of their choice


You can also:
  - Change your health status to be seen by others in your social bubbles.
  - See COVID-19 related information and a tracker of global cases, deaths, and recoveries


## Challenges we ran into
Most of our team members are quite new to development, especially considering we met in a full-stack bootcamp. One of the last things we have learned in our bootcamp is using React and Redux to build our frontend. It was difficult managing state and a single page system, but we bonded as a team and got over the challenges.

## What's next for Social Bubble
At the moment, all the bubbles are part of one network which we designed with Covid-19 in mind. In the future, we would like to have the ability to add networks for other purposes.
